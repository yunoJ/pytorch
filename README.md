## PyTorch-P2P (GPU-SSD team)
This repository is DNN training system with SSD as augmented memory of GPU based on PyTorch. Final submission plan of this research is [NSDI 2020](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/call-for-papers).

### Step (Motivation)
- TensorFlow-serving system with vDNN (Latency?)
- Spark ML with vDNN (Throughput of vDNN?)
- Computing utilization with throughput graph
- Memory usage breakdown

### Step (Implementation)
- Implementing vDNN on PyTorch
- Implementing ARCP2P on PyTorch
- Porting CycleGAN / BERT
- Performance optimization
